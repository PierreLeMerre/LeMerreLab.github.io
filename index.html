					<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">Welcome to the Le Merre Lab part of the <a href="https://www.crnl.fr/en/equipe/forgetting">Forgetting Processes and Cortical Dynamics team</a> in the <a href="https://www.crnl.fr/en2">Centre de Recherche en Neurosciences de Lyon</a>.</p>
					<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">We study how cortical networks categorize natural sounds using advanced acoustic stimulation systems, large-scale high-density electrophysiology recordings and neuronal activity manipulation. Learn more about our research project and see our previous publications. The lab fosters an open science approach (check out our previously shared data and code) and we also believe in the value of diversity in science.</p>		
					<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">The lab will soon open its doors and is hiring! If you are interested in joining us, please get in touch.</p>
